# riki-skeleton

Don't try this at home. This is a high professional skeleton for a riki application and it's not finished and not
tested. I'm even unsure if it ever will be tested but I'm sure I will use it for the r√≠ki community.

## Contribute

In every php file use PSR-2 everywhere else we will see if it looks good.

Make sure your changes work. You can try the templates with `skeleton/post-create --debug <filename>` or clone / copy
the source to a second folder and execute `composer install`.

## Start a project

To start a project using this skeleton you need php and composer installed. We strongly recommend to read [the guide](
https://riki.w00tserver.org/guide) before you start using this skeleton. Also everything is more smooth when you
develop on linux but mac would also be fine - we recommend docker and in windows you will need a VM to run docker.

```console
tflori@host $ composer create-project tflori/riki-skeleton projects/riki/community
What's the name of your project? [ tflori/community ] tflori/riki-community
